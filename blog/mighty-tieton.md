Finally stopped by the [Mighty Tieton](http://mightytieton.com) facility in [Tieton, WA](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.70460&mlon=-120.75450#map=17/46.70460/-120.75450). I've heard about their ambitious community-building and local development projects for years, but never really had a good sense of the scale or polish that's gone into their operation. Located in a tiny town of 1,200, their main facility (a 1960's fruit packing plant) houses entrepreneurial endeavors, art galleries, permanent installations, and a shipping and fulfillment center for locally-produced products. They also host and coordinate local events, large gatherings, and musical concerts. Keep an eye on these folks, and meet them if you can.
