I've been building things on the internet for more than a decade. I am fascinated by the way technology either helps or hinders ordinary people from solving real problems they face. I am especially interested in small communities and how they use technology to tell their own stories and make their communities stronger. I would love to hear about your project – [let's chat](mailto:isaac@ike.io)!

### About the Homestead

I grew up on a farm not far from the spot where this picture was taken, and I have a strong desire to eventually merge my work on the internet with simpler pursuits on the land and in small communities. This is the spot where I am starting to [write about](blog.html) that endeavor, and to collect my internet presence onto my own homestead, instead of [sharecropping](blog/indieweb.html) on the estates of the Internets' elite.

> _"When despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be, I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free."_
