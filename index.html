    <p>I am an aspiring Renaissance Kid. I tinker on the internet, working with a bunch of amazing folks at <a href="http://andyet.com">&yet</a>. I grew up on a farm not far from the spot where this picture was taken, and I have a strong desire to eventually merge my work on the internet with simpler pursuits on the land and in small communities. This is the spot where I am starting to <a href="/zlog.html">write about</a> that endeavor, and to collect my internet presence onto my own homestead, instead of <a href="https://vimeo.com/77352414">sharecropping</a> on the estates of the Internets' elite.</p>

      "When despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be, I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free."</i><p>
