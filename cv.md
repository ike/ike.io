## CV / Resumé

### Profile

Leapfrog is my favorite contact sport. Puffin watching on the cliffs of Spruce Island Alaska is what I would choose to do on vacation. I play with the web in between.

The most important thing I’ve learned is that technology moves too fast, and the best skill one can have in this field is the ability to adapt to whatever task is at hand, and use unfamiliar territory and yerba mate as rocket fuel…
