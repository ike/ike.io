## Profile
I am an aspiring Renaissance man. I believe that a diversity of interests and endeavors creates opportunities to do great things. I strive to constantly challenge myself and learn, and bring those experiences to whatever I do. As a technologist moving into the unknown territory of our future, I am here to provide an enthusiastic, reasoned voice that is backed by a wide range of perspectives and a desire to solve real human problems with technology. I am most inspired by a work environment that requires a diverse set of skills. As a manager, I endeavor to inspire individual responsibility, while providing the context and tools for success.
