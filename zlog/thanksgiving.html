  <p>“…And we pray, not for new <br>
  earth or heaven, but to be quiet <br>
  in heart, and in eye clear. <br>
  What we need is here.”  </p>

<p>We’re <a href="https://vimeo.com/52639927">really lucky bastards</a>. Here in the comfy bubble of the tech world, there’s practically no glass ceiling we won’t eventually smash through. I’ve been blessed with a <a href="http://andyet.com">company I can believe in</a>, amazing teammates, good health, and a wonderful place to live surrounded by pristine nature. I live a life filled with abundance, for which I am extremely grateful. If you ever catch me complaining, you have my permission to slap some sense into me.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that we cannot afford to become complacent in our position, but to use it to do the greatest good we can in the short time we have. As such, I am setting a personal bar for myself this Thanksgiving by giving $200 to a different cause each month. Here’s the list I’ve got so far (If you know of a cause that you think should be on my list, please get <a href="/">in touch with me</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Nov: <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/">charity: water</a></li>
<li>Dec: <a href="http://donate.worldvision.org/OA_HTML/xxwv2MicroLoan.jsp?go=micro&amp;">World Vision Micro Loan</a></li>
<li>Jan: <a href="http://www.letsrespond.com/">Let’s Respond</a></li>
<li>Feb: <a href="http://www.amazima.org/">Amazima</a></li>
<li>Mar: <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a></li>
<li>Apr: <a href="http://www.notforsalecampaign.org/">Not For Sale</a></li>
<li>May:</li>
<li>Jun:</li>
<li>Jul:</li>
<li>Aug:</li>
<li>Sep:</li>
<li>Oct:</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d really like you to join me in this endeavor. If you do, please let me know, and I’ll link you from this post.</p>

<p>Together, we can use our privileged position to do a little good in the world.</p>
