<h3>IPFS Ahoy! <code>[9-14-15]</code></h3><p>Really, really happy to see Neocities supporting IPFS now -- my site is pinned to my local machine easy as pie. Now just need to tinker with some permanent &quot;anti-server&quot; IPFS node to keep a running archive of my site physically on my desk. <em>dance dance</em> I&#39;m so excited.</p>

<p>You could probably call Justin Hall the Godfather of the indieweb. I&#39;m like, super ashamed to admit that I only learned about him today. Here&#39;s his new documentary, where he chronicles his life on the web and off, and makes a great case for breaking out of our electronic siloes to meet eachother with kindness and gratitude. Plus, it has fantastic retro-internet vibes. Enjoy!!</p>

<h3>Mighty Tieton <code>[8-18-15]</code></h3><p>Finally stopped by the <a href="http://mightytieton.com">Mighty Tieton</a> facility in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.70460&amp;mlon=-120.75450#map=17/46.70460/-120.75450">Tieton, WA</a>. I&#39;ve heard about their ambitious community-building and local development projects for years, but never really had a good sense of the scale or polish that&#39;s gone into their operation. Located in a tiny town of 1,200, their main facility (a 1960&#39;s fruit packing plant) houses entrepreneurial endeavors, art galleries, permanent installations, and a shipping and fulfillment center for locally-produced products. They also host and coordinate local events, large gatherings, and musical concerts. Keep an eye on these folks, and meet them if you can.</p></body><div id="footer"><hr class="clearfix"><nav class="center"><a href="/"><b>home</b></a><span> &#151; </span><a href="about.html"><b>about</b></a><span> &#151; </span><a href="notes.html"><b>notes</b></a><span> &#151; </span><a href="blog.html"><b>"blog"</b></a><span> &#151; </span><a href="cv.html"><b>cv</b></a><span> &#151; </span><a href="mailto:isaac@ike.io"><b>isaac@ike.io</b></a><br><br><a href="http://twitter.com/_crossdiver">Twitter</a><span> &#151; </span><a href="http://github.com/ike">Github</a><span> &#151; </span><a href="http://last.fm/user/ikelewis678">last.fm</a><span> &#151; </span><a href="/pgp.asc">PGP</a><span> &#151; </span><a href="http://crossdiver.tumblr.com">tumblr</a><span> &#151; </span><a href="gifs.html">gïƒ$</a></nav></div></html>
