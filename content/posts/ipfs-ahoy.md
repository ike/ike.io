Really, really happy to see [Neocities](http://neocities.org) supporting [IPFS](http://ipfs.io) now -- my site is pinned to my local machine easy as pie. Now just need to tinker with some permanent "anti-server" IPFS node to keep a running archive of my site physically on my desk. dance dance I'm so excited.
